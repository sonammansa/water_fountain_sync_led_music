# water_fountain_sync_led_music

FOUNT CHROMA, is a musical fountain. It pumps up the water according to a specific tone using a pump and automation circuit. Leds are also synchronised with the music and thus with the pump, which means that water is pumped and leds glow in synchronisation with the tone being played on the piezo speaker.

All these components are controlled by the arduino dueminolove board. 

HARDWARE:
1.	Bucket               : to store water
2.	Pump                 : to pump water out with large pressure
3.	Shower              : to show the sprinkle effect of water
4.	Bread-Board      : to connect leds
5.	Leds                   : to show the light effect
6.	Resistors            : for led connections
7.	Wires                 : to do connections
8.	Piezo Speaker    : to generate a sound track
9.	Home Auto-
mation circuit    : to trigger water pump
   10. Arduino Board   : to control all components
   11. USB-Serial 
        Cable                  : to connect arduino with computer
 

SOFTWARE:
Arduino IDE : It has been used to write the code for the project. Then the code is compiled and uploaded on the arduino board through which all the components are controlled.
